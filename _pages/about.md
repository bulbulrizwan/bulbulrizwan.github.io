I am a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher of GIScience at the Graz University of Technology, Institute of Geodesy, Research Group Geoinformation. I did my PhD in Geoinformation under the supervision of [Prof. Andrew U. Frank](https://frank.gerastree.at/) at [Geoinfo@TU Vienna](https://geoinfo.geo.tuwien.ac.at/). Previously, I served as an Assistant Professor at the [Institute of Space Technology](http://www.ist.edu.pk) and [National Unversity of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk).

My research interests span both theoratical and practical dimensions of GIScience.  I find special gratification in unraveling the computational complexities involved in solving intricate geospatial problems. At present, my scholarly endeavors revolve around the emerging arenas of:

:book: Geospatial Data Science <br>
:book: Geospatial  Artificial Intelligence <br>
:book: Geospatial  Knowledge Graphs <br>
:book: Geospatial  Optimization <br>

Since 2018, I have been calling the picturesque city of Graz my home, where I reside with my cherished family. During my leisure, I love doing sports üèì Table Tennis, üè∏ Badminton, and üéæ Tennis. My family and I share a mutual love for travel, indulging in sightseeing, walks, and cycling escapades. I proficiently speak English, [Urdu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu) and [Shina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shina_language) languages. German! Mein Deutsch is derzeit nicht so gut, aber ich lerne gerade Deutsch und hoffe, dass es bald besser wird :smile:
